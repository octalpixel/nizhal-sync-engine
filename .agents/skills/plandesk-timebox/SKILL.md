description: Paces a long run in pomodoro-style timeboxes over a work list the user defines — sets an interval, works items until it expires, verifies what actually completed, reports at every boundary, and continues into the next box while work remains. Chain it onto another skill ("/plandesk-timebox 25m /plandesk-foreman next") or run it bare over a list of items. Use whenever asked to timebox, pomodoro, work in sprints or intervals, keep going for an hour, check in every N minutes, or grind through a list without going dark.

# Work in timeboxes

A pacing posture, not a task. It wraps a run in fixed intervals so a long
session surfaces on a cadence instead of disappearing for an hour and coming
back with a wall of diff.

The work list is **yours, not the board's**. Timebox drives what you handed it —
a list of things you want done, in the order you want them. It can be pointed at
the board when you ask for that explicitly, but it never goes shopping for work
on its own.

## How to chain it

```
/plandesk-timebox 25m /plandesk-foreman next     # a box per board item
/plandesk-timebox 50m                            # bare: paces the list you give it
/plandesk-timebox 25m clear the board            # explicit opt-in to board-driven work
/plandesk-autonomy /plandesk-timebox 25m /plandesk-foreman next
                                                 # no permission pauses, plus a surfacing cadence
```

Stacking with [autonomy](../plandesk-autonomy/SKILL.md) is the common pairing and the two
do different jobs: autonomy removes the pause between steps, timebox adds a
rhythm and a report. Neither grants a permission the wrapped skill didn't
already have.

## Harness primitives — use what the runtime gives you

Timebox is harness-neutral. Prefer the scheduler and shell tools your runtime
exposes; fall back to the portable stamp when it does not. **Never poll** — do
not schedule short wakeups to check on background work the dispatch monitor
already watches; that is wasted work ([heartbeat.md](../../factory/heartbeat.md)).

| capability | Cursor | Claude Code | Codex | Pi | OpenCode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| work-list scratchpad | `TaskCreate` / `TaskList` / `TaskUpdate` | same harness task tools | `runs/tasks-<task>.md` | `TaskCreate` (pi-loop fallback) or pi-tasks | session notes / plugin tasks |
| background command | Shell `run_in_background` + `Await` | Bash `run_in_background` | background flag if present | `MonitorCreate` (pi-loop) | `/background` (monitor plugin) |
| one-shot resume | backgrounded `sleep` sentinel (see Cursor specifics) | `ScheduleWakeup` | — (use external cron) | `schedule_loop_wakeup` / `LoopCreate` (extensions) | `ScheduleWakeup` (opencode-routines) |
| recurring loop | — | `/loop` + `ScheduleWakeup` | `.codex/automations/*.toml` | `LoopCreate` / `/loop` (pi-loop) | `LoopCreate` / `/loop` (routines plugin) |
| portable clock | `date +%s` at item boundaries | same | same | same | same |

**Common pattern that works everywhere:**

1. **List on the harness** — `TaskCreate` one task per work item (lead session) or
   `runs/tasks-<task>.md` (delegated worker). Add a meta task `timebox:state`
   holding box number, `box_start` epoch, and interval seconds.
2. **Clock at boundaries** — after each item, read elapsed with `date +%s` against
   `box_start`. This is the universal fallback and always binds.
3. **Scheduler when present** — if the runtime exposes `ScheduleWakeup` (or Pi /
   OpenCode loop tools), use it only to **resume this run across turns** after
   a checkpoint — not to re-fire an expensive slash command verbatim.
4. **Background through the harness** — dispatch workers with `run_in_background`
   (never `&` / `nohup`); completion is the **result file**
   (`runs/result-<task>.json`), watched by the monitor armed at dispatch —
   `Await` the monitor shell, and treat the harness's own exit notification as
   a hint only. See [protocol.md](../../factory/protocol.md).

**Cursor specifics.** There is no scheduler tool, but there is a working box
timer: at each box start, background a sentinel shell —

```bash
sleep {interval_seconds} && echo "TIMEBOX: box {n} boundary"
```

— with `run_in_background` (block_until_ms 0). Its completion notification is
delivered even after your turn ends and **resumes the run**, so a box boundary
can wake you instead of relying on you noticing the stamp. This is the
documented sleep-and-echo self-notification pattern, not polling: one shell
per box, armed once, disarmed (kill the pid) when the list empties early. The
`date +%s` stamp at item boundaries stays the authority on whether the box has
actually expired — the sentinel is the wakeup, not the clock.

**Claude Code specifics.** `ScheduleWakeup` clamps `delaySeconds` to 60–3600.
Pass a plain continuation prompt ("Continue timebox box 3; pick up item X from
TaskList"), never a `/`-prefixed slash command — re-firing those duplicates
expensive work. End the loop with `stop: true` when the list is empty. Foreground
`sleep` for the full interval is blocked; use the scheduler or keep working and
check the stamp at item boundaries.

**Codex specifics.** No in-session scheduler in mainline Codex today. Pace with
`date +%s` inside the session, or stand up `.codex/automations/*.toml` /
external cron for durable recurring runs outside this skill.

**Pi / OpenCode specifics.** Loop extensions (`pi-loop`, `opencode-routines`)
are the richest schedulers — prefer fixed-interval `LoopCreate` over self-paced
re-scheduling when you want a predictable pomodoro cadence. Coalesced delivery
while busy is correct: the box boundary fires when the in-flight item finishes.

## Set up the run

1. **Get the work list.** Ask for it if it wasn't given: a list of items, a file
   to work through, or a scope of changes. Write it down as harness tasks
   (`TaskCreate`) — one per item, plus `timebox:state` (box number, start epoch,
   interval). If the user said "clear the board" or named the board explicitly,
   the list is `get_next_task` — but only then.
2. **Set the interval.** Default 25 minutes when unspecified. Parse user input:
   `25m`, `1h`, `90 minutes` → seconds once at setup. "Work for an hour" means
   one 60-minute box, not three of twenty.
3. **Stamp the clock.**
   ```bash
   date +%s    # box_start; persist in timebox:state and/or TaskUpdate metadata
   ```
   If `ScheduleWakeup` / loop tools are available and the run may span multiple
   turns, also record `box_end = box_start + interval_seconds` so the wakeup
   prompt knows which box to report.
4. **Say the plan back** in one line: the interval, the item count, and what
   happens at the first boundary. A run nobody can predict is a run nobody can
   interrupt at a good moment.

## The cycle

```
box_start = read from timebox:state (or date +%s on first box)
arm the box timer if the harness has one    # Cursor: sentinel sleep; Claude: ScheduleWakeup
loop:
  item = next pending harness task (skip timebox:state)
  if item is null:
    stop — the list is done; final report; disarm timer / ScheduleWakeup stop
  work(item)                       # the wrapped skill's own procedure, in full
  verify(item)                     # its own completion check — exit codes, not claims
  TaskUpdate(item, completed)      # or mark Done in runs/tasks-*.md
  commit/checkpoint(item)          # leave nothing half-applied
  if (date +%s) - box_start >= interval_seconds:
    checkpoint_report()            # see the template below — then KEEP GOING
    increment box number in timebox:state
    box_start = date +%s
    re-arm the box timer for the new box
  continue loop                    # same turn — the report is not a turn boundary
```

**Inside a box with a background dispatch:** background the worker per
[protocol.md](../../factory/protocol.md), keep working on what you can in the
foreground, and `Await` (or watch `runs/result-<task>.json`) for completion —
do not schedule timer polls for it. The box timer and the worker timer are
independent; an expiring box still lets the in-flight item finish first.

## The boundary rule — the timer is a checkpoint, not a kill signal

**When the interval expires mid-item, let the item finish.** Then verify,
commit, mark the harness task complete, and only then checkpoint.

This is the whole design decision, and the reason is concrete: cutting a run
mid-item strands work in exactly the state that is hardest to recover — a worker
part-way through a change, nothing staged, nothing verified, and a report that
cannot honestly say what landed. A box that runs four minutes long costs four
minutes. A box that cuts clean through a dispatch costs the item.

So the interval governs *how often you surface*, never *where the work stops*.
If an item is so large that it routinely blows the box, that is a sizing
problem — say so at the checkpoint and suggest splitting it, rather than
shrinking the box until it cuts.

## The checkpoint report

At each boundary, keep it short enough to read on a phone:

```
Box N (25m) — 3 items, 2 done, 1 carried

  done      <item> — <what proves it: command + exit code>
  done      <item> — <proof>
  carried   <item> — <where it stands, what is next>

Next box: <what it will pick up>.  Remaining: <count>.
```

Report what is *proven*, not what was attempted. An item without a verification
result is `carried`, not `done` — this is the check the interval exists to
force, and reporting an unverified item as done makes every later box's report
worthless.

Then continue into the next box **in the same turn — do not end your turn
after a checkpoint.** Ending the turn is how a run silently converts a report
into a permission request: in a harness with no scheduler, nothing wakes you,
and the run dies with "say continue for box 3" — which is exactly the pause
the wrapper was invoked to remove. Never write "say continue", "shall I
proceed", or any variant; the only legitimate turn-enders are the stop
conditions below. The checkpoint is a surfacing moment, not a permission
request: the human reads it if they are there and **interrupts** if they want
to — interruption is their affordance, not something you solicit. Lane gates
still bind — see [lanes.md](../../factory/lanes.md) and
[autonomy](../plandesk-autonomy/SKILL.md).

## Breaks

After four boxes, take a longer checkpoint: re-read the work list (`TaskList` or
`runs/tasks-*.md`) against what actually landed, drop items that are now moot,
and say whether the remaining list still matches what the user wanted. Long runs
drift — the plan made sense ninety minutes ago and the fourth box is where that
is worth checking.

This is the agent's version of the pomodoro break. It is not idle time; it is
the moment the list gets re-derived from reality rather than from memory.

## When to stop instead of starting another box

- The list is empty. Report and end — do not go looking for adjacent work. Disarm
  any loop / `ScheduleWakeup` with `stop: true` or `LoopDelete`.
- Every remaining item is blocked, or gated on input you cannot obtain. Report
  what is blocking and on whom.
- Two consecutive boxes closed nothing. Something is wrong with the sizing, the
  environment, or the plan; another box will not fix it. Say what you observed
  and stop.
- The user asked for a fixed number of boxes and you have finished them.

## Gotchas

- Timeboxing paces work; it does not authorize any. A wrapped skill's lane gates
  and boundaries bind unchanged — see [autonomy](../plandesk-autonomy/SKILL.md).
- **`date +%s` always works; schedulers are optional.** Do not fail to timebox
  because `ScheduleWakeup` is absent — the stamp at item boundaries is the
  portable core.
- **Never poll background work on a timer.** The dispatch monitor watches the
  result file and reports completion ([protocol.md](../../factory/protocol.md));
  heartbeat wakeups are for stall detection only ([heartbeat.md](../../factory/heartbeat.md)).
- The clock is read at boundaries, so it is only as granular as your items. One
  90-minute item inside a 25-minute box produces one box, not four — that is
  correct behavior, and the checkpoint should name it as a sizing problem.
- Do not let the box become a deadline the work is rushed to fit. Skipping
  verification to land inside the interval defeats the entire point; the box is
  a reporting rhythm, not a budget.
- A checkpoint is not a turn boundary. If you catch yourself typing "say
  continue" or "ready for box N?", delete it and start the next item — the
  human interrupts when they want to; you never solicit it.
- Harness tasks are the per-session scratchpad for the list. If the run is
  board-driven, the board stays the source of truth and the harness list is
  re-derived from it after any compaction.
