# grok

Fast implementation worker. Which worker is the default IC is routing data,
not a worker-file fact — see [../routing.md](../routing.md). **`< /dev/null` is mandatory** on
background fires — otherwise grok blocks on stdin with no output. Model ids
change between releases — run `grok models` and pin what is actually installed; a stale id fails the
dispatch immediately with "unknown model id". Never pass `--sandbox` — omitting it grants full IC
access; `--sandbox` is opt-in to restrict, only for untrusted third-party
code.

**Free-tier accounts hit a usage limit.** When they do, grok exits 0 having
written nothing — the run reads as a clean success unless you check for the
result file. Observed twice. This is the case the result-contract rule exists
for: the file is the completion signal, not the exit code.

Dispatch rule: run `probe` first — if it fails, this worker does not exist on
this machine; pick another file in this directory. Then substitute the
placeholders — `{prompt_file}` with the brief path, `{repo_path}` with the
absolute repo or worktree path — and dispatch per
[../protocol.md](../protocol.md), which appends the log redirect and
backgrounds the run. Change the flags here, never in a brief. The result
contract is defined in the same file.
